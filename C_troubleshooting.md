### Regarding the structure of some of the database files

##### Question:

Can anyone tell me what the columns of the SPECFEM2D boundary condition files in `SPECFEM2D/DATA/`
`Mesh_canyon` are?

        SPECFEM2D/DATA/Mesh_canyon/canyon_absorbing_surface_file
        SPECFEM2D/DATA/Mesh_canyon/canyon_free_surface_file

##### Answer:

`canyon_absorbing_surface_file` refers to parameters related to the absorbing conditions: The first number (180) is the number of absorbing elements (nelemabs in the code). Then the columns are:

1.  the element number

2.  the number of nodes of this element that form the absorbing surface

3.  the first node

4.  the second node

`canyon_free_surface_file` refers to the elements of the free surface (relevant for enforcing free surface condition for acoustic media): The first number (160) is the number of elements of the free surface. Then the columns are (similar to the absorbing case):

1.  the element number

2.  the number of nodes of this element that form the absorbing surface

3.  the first node

4.  the second node

Concerning the free surface description file, nodes/edges pertaining to elastic elements are discarded when the file is read (if for whatever reason it was simpler to include all the nodes/edges on one side of a studied area and that there are among them some elements that are elastic elements, only the nodes/edges of acoustic elements are kept).

These files are opened and read in `meshfem2D.F90` using subroutines `read_abs_surface()` and `read_`
`acoustic_surface()`, which are in `part_unstruct.F90`
