<p>The SPECFEM2D package was first developed by Dimitri Komatitsch and Jean-Pierre Vilotte at Institut de Physique du Globe (IPGP) in Paris, France from 1995 to 1997 and then by Dimitri Komatitsch at Harvard University (USA), Caltech (USA) and then CNRS and University of Pau (France) from 1998 to 2005. The story started on April 4, 1995, when Prof. Yvon Maday from CNRS and University of Paris, France, gave a lecture to Dimitri Komatitsch and Jean-Pierre Vilotte at IPG about the nice properties of the Legendre spectral-element method with diagonal mass matrix that he had used for other equations. We are deeply indebted and thankful to him for that. That followed a visit by Dimitri Komatitsch to OGS (Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale) in Trieste, Italy, in February 1995 to meet with Géza Seriani and Enrico Priolo, who introduced him to their 2D Chebyshev version of the spectral-element method with a non-diagonal mass matrix. We are deeply indebted and thankful to them for that.</p>

<p>Since then it has been developed and maintained by a development team: in alphabetical order, Étienne Bachmann, Alexis Bottero, Quentin Brissaud, Paul Cristini, Dimitri Komatitsch, Jesús Labarta, Nicolas Le Goff, Pieyre Le Loher, Qinya Liu, Youshan Liu, Roland Martin, René Matzen, Christina Morency, Masaru Nagaso, Daniel Peter, Carl Tape, Jeroen Tromp, Jean-Pierre Vilotte, Zhinan Xie.</p>
